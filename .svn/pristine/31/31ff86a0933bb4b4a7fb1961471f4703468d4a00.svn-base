				<p class="style1">Tweed Heads North and Wollongong are two different costal town centres. One with a fast growing older population and the other with an older population that is growing with the city. By contrasting the two we hope to identify potential benefits to existing solutions as to offer suggestions to both town centres.</p>

Additionally it is quite apparent that Wollongong has a more positive result in comparison to Tweed Heads.</p></td>

Of these comments, all of them were negative and most extremely negative due to the injuries they could potentially cause. Service covers in both town centres were always pointed out as trip hazards. Additionally a number of slip hazards were noted in Wollongong pertaining to the leaves from trees in autumn. However participants from both areas commented positively on the large width walkway areas.</p>

Wollongong com- mented on the number of benches along the walk route, however noted the protruding bolts on the benches as a problem and the presence of smokers in the area decreased the availability of viable benches.</p>

Shared walkways (bike and pedes- trian in Tweed Heads, bike, pedestrian and car in Wollongong) did not have very visible signage, however Wollongong did have line markings. Signs to indicate road names and directions were mainly for road traffic and not pedestrians (ie street sign in the middle of the roundabout, Tweed Heads)</p>
