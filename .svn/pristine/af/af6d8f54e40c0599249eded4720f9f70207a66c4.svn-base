					The Wollongong trials occurred on the Friday 11th May 2012 where another two walks took place. There were two groups, one in the morning and another in the afternoon, taken on the same route shown below.<br>
					The two groups consisted of four people each with a total of five female and three males. The average age was higher but the volunteers were also fit and part of the community group for older people.</p>
